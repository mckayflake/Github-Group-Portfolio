# MSBA Capstone Project: Swire Coca-Cola (Sponsor)
**Group 10: McKay Flake, Raunak Sharma, Hunter Harmer**

## Project Overview  
This repository contains the code and documentation developed as part of the MSBA Capstone project for Swire Coca-Cola. The project aims to reduce maintenance costs and minimize downtime by predicting machinery failures in Swire Coca-Colaâ€™s bottling operations.

## Business Problem  
Swire Coca-Cola operates a network of six production plants and nearly 50 distribution centers across 13 states in the Western US. Unplanned machinery failures cause unpredictable downtime, leading to significant revenue loss-estimated at nearly $60 million annually. These failures result in halted production, decreased product availability, urgent repair costs, and delayed distribution schedules.

## Key Objective  
The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive solutions to anticipate machinery failures, minimize downtime, and improve operational efficiency.

## Solution  
We developed predictive models to estimate downtime duration and conducted a break-even analysis to recommend optimal planned maintenance hours, providing actionable strategies to reduce maintenance costs, minimize downtime, and improve operational efficiency.

## Repository Contents  
This repository includes the following sections, each contributing to solving the business problem outlined:

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
In this section, we perform a detailed analysis of the provided dataset, which includes:  
- Investigating patterns in machinery failures.  
- Identifying correlations between key variables.  
- Understanding factors contributing to machinery failures.  

EDA helps in establishing a baseline for standard downtime and generating target variables for prediction.

### 2. **Modeling Process**  
This section explores the predictive modeling workflow, including:  
- **Model Exploration**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost were tested.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Addressing missing values, feature engineering, and dataset preparation.  
- **Model Training**: Training models to estimate machinery failure and downtime.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing parameters for improved performance.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Selecting the best-performing model for predicting machinery failure and downtime.

The modeling process delivers predictive insights for optimizing downtime mitigation and maintenance prioritization.

### 3. **Presentation PDF**  
The final presentation document summarizes:  
- Project methodology.  
- Key findings and results.  
- Recommendations for Swire Coca-Cola.

The presentation consolidates findings into actionable, data-driven strategies for operational efficiency.
