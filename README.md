Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation developed as part of the MSBA Capstone project for Swire Coca-Cola. The project aims to reduce maintenance costs and minimize downtime by predicting machinery failures in Swire Coca-Cola’s bottling operations.
Business Problem
Swire Coca-Cola operates a network of six production plants and nearly 50 distribution centers across 13 states in the Western US. Unplanned machinery failures cause unpredictable downtime, leading to significant revenue loss—estimated at nearly $60 million annually. These failures result in halted production, decreased product availability, urgent repair costs, and delayed distribution.

This repository includes the following sections, each contributing to solving the business problem outlined:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, we perform a detailed analysis of the provided dataset, which includes investigating patterns, identifying correlations, and understanding factors contributing to machinery failures. EDA helps in establishing a baseline for standard downtime and generating target variables for prediction.

Modeling Process
Here, we explore various predictive models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Time Series Models. After thorough testing, we select the best-performing model for predicting machinery failure and downtime. The process involves data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

Presentation PDF
The final PDF presentation summarizes our methodology, findings, results, and recommendations for Swire Coca-Cola. This document provides a comprehensive overview of how the predictive model can be used to improve operations.
